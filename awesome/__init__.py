"""
The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat directories containing the file as packages. 
This prevents directories with a common name, such as string, unintentionally hiding valid modules 
that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty 
file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable.
